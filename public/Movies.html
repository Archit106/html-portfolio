<h3>Panchayat season 3</h3>
<p>I enjoyed the subtle nature of the series and how they potrayed the diffrent characters of the village also the acting of all the actors involved is amazing and on point</p>
<h3>Suits</h3>
<p>i enjoyed and was encapsulated how the series showcased the world of legalities and the acting is brilliant as well  </p>
<h3>A Quite Place</h3>
<p>the main selling point of the movies is that how well it conveys the emotion and situations despite having almost no dialoges </p>
